# NBTConverter

This is a simple tool for loading minecraft NBT data (.dat files) and converting them to JSON. The functionality of converting those files back is not yet finished and will come at a later date.

This tool is not yet complete and not really useful unless you're willing to add some code into it yourself.

This tool was made as I could not find any tool that would allow me to modify a lot of similar NBT tags in a file without doing it manually.
